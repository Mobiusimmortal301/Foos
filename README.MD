ToDo
===
normalize the teams, winners, players, tables (configured through orm or switch to writing sprocs)
foreign key off names (not a great idea, but an okay stop gap)
track wins/losses of teams and players
add unified system for success/error messages
add proper authentication and local persistence
investigate using servicestack.bundler to simplify extending app (not having to manually add new js files to list)
