#Foos#
Foos is an webapp dedicated to recording foosball scores and providing data for later use. It is built using AngularJS v12.16 and ServiceStack v4.

##Intent##
Foos is a small personal project, designed with just three purposes in mind:

* Find out who the best NCR in-house Foosball player is. (hint: it's not me).
* Familiarize myself with ServiceStack, particularly in contrast to Web Api 2
* Try out some different approaches to authentication and routing. Particularly, using ui.router instead of ngRoute, and extending ui.router to provide well integrated authentication.

##Technology##
Foos front-end is built upon AngularJS and AngularUI.
The server is built using ServiceStack. I am currently using ServiceStack.Ormlite for back-end persistence, but may change the database layer to something more customized, due to personal preference over ORMs in general.

##Api and Logging##
The restful api can be viewed at /metadata.

Debugging logs can be viewed at /requestlogs. This will likely be disabled if Foos ever gets hosted publicly and/or taken seriously.

##Open Source##
Foos is an open source project, licensed under the Apache License.

##ToDo##
* track wins/losses of teams and players
* incorporate position into ui and player data
* hyperlinks to different data sets across review pages
* may break posting of team and player separate from match, so that match can post with just their ids instead of whole object
* tie userAuth into return match data (stored in db, but make accessible by name via api)
* consider adding local persistence for user, would use ss-id cookie for session id, but username is encrypted, so not sure how to restore that to the browser for viewing, and I dont want to maintain the auth state separately
* fix for requiring rootscope to broadcast alerts (should be able to $scope.$emit and have parent headCtrl receive (but my implementation is not compatible with ui.router seeing it as a parent/child relationship I think)
* investigate a bundler for scripts, app js, and css directories. Minimize overhead of extending or publishing app (MVC was good at this)
* change metadata, auth, register, etc paths to /api/{service}
* customize metadata page, https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Metadata-page
